== skip lib check ==

Commonly, a program includes many dependencies, which may include large declaration files, which usually are checked by their authors already. But, *the compiler* spends a lot of time *checking* these declarations again anyway, so, large programs may take a lot of time to compile. So, the idea behind this option is to *shorten* the compile time by avoiding type checks of these declarations. 

--skipLibCheck forces the compiler to skip type checking all declaration files.

Enabling the `skipLibCheck` option instructs the compiler to skip type checking of all declaration (*.d.ts) files. This includes the *.d.ts files from the node_modules directory and your custom *.d.ts files

**tsc** (Typescript compiler) needs a JSON configuration file.
When you run the `tsc` command in a directory, Typescript compiler looks for the
`tsconfig.json` file in the current directory and if it doesn't find one, then
it *keeps looking up* the directory tree until it find one. 
The directory where the `tsconfig.json` is located is considered the root of
the project.

The `--project` flag can provide the path to the `tsconfig.json` file.
If you want, you can use a different for this file when using this flag.

Example:
`tsc --project ./config/tsconfig.cjs.json`

=== structure of `tsconfig.json` ===

- Supports *JSON5* specifications, you can use comments, single quotes.
- Contains root-level options and compilerOptions.

*Root-level options*

- Control how the project is presented to the Typescript compiler.
- Files to compile, excluded files,
